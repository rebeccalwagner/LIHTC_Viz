For this project, I used AI in strategic ways. 

Primarily, this had to do with writing code. I did all my own data exploration and preprocessing,so that I knew what variables I was working with and what narrative I wanted to tell. From this knowledge, I was able to easily imagine the types of visualizations that I wanted to create. From there, I could describe these visualizations to an LLM, and have it help me with the code. 

For instance, I might say "I would like a stacked line graph that displays the percentage of LIHTC projects that are in QTCs and/or DDAs, in R," and the LLM would give me some code snippets that I could use to create a visualization. 

I also used LLM's to standardize my themes. Once I had a graph where I liked the color palette and theme, I could pass that graph to the LLM along with my new graph, and ask it to standardize. This saved me a lot of time along the way! 

Additonally, I used LLM's to debug as needed throughout the process. Overall, I found LLMs to be useful and save me a lot of time when working on this project. However, it was neccesary for me to have relevant domain knoweldge to both design relevant visualizations, and ensure that the output I recieved was correct.
