## Project Overview

The Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is the federal government's primary program for encouraging the development of affordable rental housing. This project provides a comprehensive visual analysis of LIHTC allocations, examining:

- Historical trends in program usage
- Geographic distribution across states
- Patterns in Difficult Development Areas (DDAs) and Qualified Census Tracts (QCTs)
- Missing data patterns and data quality
- Distribution of low-income housing units
